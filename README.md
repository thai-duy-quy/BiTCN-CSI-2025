# Human Activity Recognition Based on Wi-Fi CSI Using Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (BiTCN) 
## Introduction
BiTCN-CSI-2025 is the library for WiFi CSI HAR that using Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (BiTCN). It is implemented by PyTorch. This is our paper, which under review in  [*The Fourteenth International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing*]([https://doi.org/10.3390/s25041038](https://2026umediaconf.com/)).
