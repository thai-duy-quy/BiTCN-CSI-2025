# Human Activity Recognition Based on Wi-Fi CSI Using Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (BiTCN) 
## Introduction
BiTCN-CSI-2025 is a library for Wi-Fi CSIâ€“based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using a Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (BiTCN). It is implemented in PyTorch. This work corresponds to our paper, which is currently under review in [*The Fourteenth International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing*](https://2026umediaconf.com/).
