# Enhanced Wi-Fi Sensing: Leveraging Phase and Amplitude of CSI for Superior Accuracy
## Introduction
PA-CSI is the library for WiFi CSI HAR that leverages both amplitude and phase features from Wi-Fi signals, incorporating attention mechanisms across both temporal and channel dimensions, along with multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It is implemented by PyTorch and Tensorflow. This is our paper [*Enhanced Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi Sensing: Leveraging Phase and Amplitude with Attention Mechanisms*](https://doi.org/10.3390/s25041038).
